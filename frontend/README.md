## Key Components

### **APIService**
- Singleton service for backend communication
- Handles file uploads, text summarization, and error management
- Built with modern async/await patterns

### **ContentView**
- Main app coordinator managing application state
- Orchestrates navigation between different views
- Handles file processing workflow

### **Document Scanner**
- Native VisionKit integration for document scanning
- Multi-page document support
- Automatic image processing and optimization

### **File Picker**
- Universal document picker supporting multiple file types
- Security-scoped resource access
- Type validation and error handling

### **Summary Display**

## Backend Integration

The app communicates with the QuickScan Rust backend API:

### **Endpoints Used**
- `POST /api/upload` - File upload
- `POST /api/summarize` - Text summarization
- `GET /api/health` - Server health check

### **Data Flow**
1. User selects document (camera or file picker)
2. File is uploaded to backend server
3. Text content is extracted and sent for summarization
4. AI-generated summary is displayed with statistics

## Requirements

### **iOS Version**
- iOS 17.0 or later
- iPhone and iPad compatible

### **Xcode**
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- Swift 5.9+

### **Permissions**
- Camera access for document scanning
- Photo library access for file selection

## Setup Instructions

### **1. Open Project**
```bash
open QuickScan.xcodeproj
```

### **2. Configure Backend URL**
Update the `baseURL` in `APIService.swift` to point to your backend:
```swift
private let baseURL = "http://your-backend-url:3000/api"
```

### **3. Build and Run**
- Select your target device or simulator
- Press Cmd+R to build and run
